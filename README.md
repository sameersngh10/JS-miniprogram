## About

The **JS Mini Programs** repository is a collection of simple yet educational JavaScript programs. These mini programs are perfect for beginners looking to understand the basics of JavaScript programming. Each program is accompanied by an HTML file that links to the JavaScript code, allowing you to see the program in action.

## Getting Started

To get started with the mini programs:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/js-mini-programs.git


## Navigate to the project directory:
    cd js-mini-programs

## Open any HTML file in your browser:
    You can open the HTML files directly in your browser to run the JavaScript programs.

## Programs Included
    Here is a list of some of the programs included in this repository:

  Factorial Calculation:

    factorial.html - HTML file to run the factorial program.
    factorial.js - JavaScript file that calculates the factorial of a given number.

  Prime Number Check:

    prime.html - HTML file to run the prime number check program.
    prime.js - JavaScript file that checks if a given number is prime.
  Additional Programs:

    More programs will be added to this repository, each with its own HTML and JavaScript files.
## Usage
  To use the programs:

  Open the desired HTML file in your browser.
  Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the JavaScript program.
  View the output directly in your browser.
  For example, to check if a number is prime, open the prime.html file, enter a number, and see if the program identifies it as prime or not.
